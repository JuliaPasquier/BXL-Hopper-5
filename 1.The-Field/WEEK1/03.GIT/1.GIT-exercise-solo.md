## GIT and GITHUB

- Type of challenge: **exercise solo**
- Duration: **4h**

### Learning objectives

At the end of this challenge, you should be able to:

- Use the knowledge you acquired with the terminal and Markdown to write a document in a workflow using GIT.
- Initialize a git repository
- Upload it to GitHub
- Clone a repository
- Use different branches to build up your document.
- Use commits.
- Merge branches
- Resolve eventual conflicts between branches.
- Push to GitHub your final work

### The challenge

- Using your terminal, go to the Desktop on your computer
- Create a folder `/myGitExercise`
- Inside of it, create a `Readme.md`
- Open it in VS Code

We're gonna write down a schedule for your next Saturday.

In order to do that, create a skeleton of the day using headers in Markdown :

**MORNING**

**09h00 - 10h00**

**10h00 - 12h00**

**AFTERNOON**

**12h00 - 13h00**

**13h00 - 17h00**

**EVENING**

**17h00 - ¬†20h00**

**NIGHT**

**20h00 - 00h00**

- Once this skeleton is done, create different branches from the main one : `feature-morning`, `feature-afternoon`, `feature-evening` and `feature-night.`
- One after the other, checkout to each branch and fill out what you will do in those hours. (eventually change the hours according to your plans)
- Each time you finish writing in a branch, commit your work.
- When you're done with each branch, go to the first one (`feature-morning`) and make a pull request to the main branch.
- Review your pull request and solve the eventual conflicts.
- Merge your branch.
- Close the pull request, terminating the branch.
- Do the same for the other branches.

You have a final version of your schedule !!! Great job ! üëè

Oups ! You just remembered you have to visit your grandma for her birthday between 14h30 and 17h30. You must reschedule certain things.

- Create a new branch `bug-fix-grandma`
- Reallocate your time in the document.

- Review pull request and merge

Ouuffff‚Ä¶ That was hard‚Ä¶ But you got it !!!!!

You are J-U-S-T ¬†A-W-E-S-O-M-E !!!!!
