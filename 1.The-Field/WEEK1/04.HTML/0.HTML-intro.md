**Hellooooww there !**

Oufff… what a journey into the Terminal and Git !!! Congratulations ! You survived ! Today, we will start our path into HTML and CSS.

## HTML

HTML is a markup language (like Markdown).

What does that mean ?

> _Markup language is a text-encoding system consisting of a set of symbols inserted in a text document to control its structure, formatting, or the relationship between its parts._

Basically, we use _**marks**_ to define what is a heading, what is a paragraph, a list, a quote, a table, etc.

As you saw, the marks on Markdown look like something like that :

`# Main title`

`## Secondary title`

`- List item`

`**bold** text`

etc.

In a markdown reader (like the one you have in front of your eyes right now), this renders :

---

## Main title

### Secondary title

- List item

**bold** text

---

HTML has _**marks**_ as well, slightly different and much more robust. They are so close in their terms that you can even convert one into the other.

Test [this](https://markdowntohtml.com/). (not ideal but it makes my point)

Think of that :

If you were speaking on the phone with someone and trying to tell her how to write this article :

![](https://i1.rgstatic.net/publication/272871756_Writing_an_academic_paper_for_publication/links/54f5e3fd0cf2ca5efefd4a4a/largepreview.png)

You will have to tell her that the header's content is “Writing an academic paper for publication” and that it's bold and bigger than the rest of the text etc.

The same thing you do with markdown and Html. You are constantly describing the form of content you're writing.

HTML was invented by Tim Berners Lee on 1989 in order to help describe the structure of academic papers on the very early internet, when its main purpose was to share academic papers among peers.

An academic paper is a text that follows very precise conventions (header, subheader, sections, paragraphs, lists, tables, images, etc) in a very clear hierarchy.

HTML, in a Microsoft Word style, can define that a specific piece of text is the title, a subtitle, that a specific word is bold, etc. And… Brand new from the web : we can now create _**links**_ ! So if an article makes reference to another, we can click it and redirect to the other one.

---

From that, we get to a very obvious and sad realization : HTML was **NOT** created to build the very complex modern websites we have today. Developing modern websites is a constant _hack_ of a language and styling convention in order to make HTML compliant with our needs.

That's why it's so important to understand how to structure an HTML page, a language that was really not supposed to do this.
