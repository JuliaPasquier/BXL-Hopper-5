## Basic digital color theory

---

Although in CSS we can use named colors (like red, blue, pink, orange, gold, etc.), most of the time you will use the standard digital color codes.

The main ones are RGB and HEX.

### RGB

RGB stands for RED, GREEN, BLUE. They are the three channels that, merged together, can represent any color. The range for each channel is between 0 and 255.

So‚Ä¶ if we put zero red, zero green and zero blue, what will we have ? Black !

In the contrary, if we put 255 red, 255 green and 255 blue ? White !

All the other combinations will add more or less of each color to result into any color we want.

### HEX

Hexadecimal color notation still follows the red, green, blue logic. But its notation is different : instead of numbers from 0 to 255, it's from 0 to 9 and ‚Äúa‚Äù to ‚Äúf‚Äù

Either way, it's very easy to convert one to another. Also, VSCode gives you a color picker that spits out the hexadecimal (or rgb) automatically. So don't put too much energy into understanding this (although it's a really nice-to-have) üòÇ

Colors are a problem for designers. As front end, you will only need to replicate the colors they provided for you.

In programs like Figma, Adobe XD etc. You'll automatically have the RGB or HEX given to you.

If you don't have one, always use a color picker.
