## CSS

### Intro

#### What is it ?

CSS is a language for describing how documents are presented visually - how they are arranged and styled.

#### What does it stand for ?

CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheet. We'll cover the “cascading” part in a bit. Don't worry about it now.

#### There's a lot!

CSS is very easy to get the hang of, but it can be intimidating because of how many properties we can manipulate.

#### CSS rules

(almost) Everything you do in CSS follows this basic pattern :

Want to get fancy ? Select every other text input and give it a red border of 2px :

### Including styles

#### Inline

You can write your styles directly inline on each element, but this is **NOT A GOOD IDEA** most of the time.

#### The \<style> element

You can write your styles inside of a \<style> element in the html head. This is easy, but it makes it impossible to share styles between documents. **Not recommended either**.

#### External stylesheet

Write your style in a .css file and then include it using the \<link> in the head of your html document. **RECOMMENDED**
