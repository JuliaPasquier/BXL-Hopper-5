### Function expressions

Did you know a function can be store in a variable ?

Look at this :

```js
function myFunc() {
  console.log("I'm a function");
}
```

is the exact same as :

```js
const myFunc = function () {
  console.log("I'm a function");
};
```

Why is it important to know that ?

Because of...

### Higher order functions

We can pass a functions as an argument to another function !

Let's see :

```js
const callTwice = function (func) {
  func();
  func();
};

// Here, the callTwice function takes another function as a parameter and call it two times

const rollDie = function () {
  const roll = Math.floor(Math.random() * 6 + 1);
  console.log(roll);
};

callTwice(rollDie);
```

Test it for yourself ;)

Exercise :

How could you create a function that takes a rollDie function as a parameter and the amount of times it should call the function inside of it ?

For now, you might not see the purpose of a higher order function. But we will soon get there ;)
