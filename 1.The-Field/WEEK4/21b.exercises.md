### Exercise on functions

---

Let's write function that throws as many dice we want with as many faces we want.

- Write a function that takes two parameters `faces` and `times`
- Inside of it, log to the console `times` times a die with `faces` faces.
- Console log : `die 1 : result`, `die 2 : result` for each die.

Expected result for, for example, `(6, 5)` (the numbers should be random of course)

```
"Die 1: 4"
"Die 2: 1"
"Die 3: 1"
"Die 4: 6"
"Die 5: 3"
```

---

Let's write a function that takes as parameter a string and the amount of times we want to repeat it.
Then, log to the console the result.

Example:

```js
repeat("$", 5);
// expected result : "$$$$$"
```

Remember to test if the number is actually a number

---

Let's write a function that takes a `firstName` and a `lastName` as parameters and presents gives the full name with the lastName being an inital.

Example :

```js
greet("Marlon", "Brandon");

// expected result : "This is Marlon B."
```

---

Let's do an experiment :

Make a simple function that takes two numbers and add them.

Then, store the result of the function to a variable and log to the console the value of the variable :

(Make sure you verify if the parameters are actual numbers)

```js
const myVariable = sum(3, 6);
console.log(myVariable);

// Expected result : 9
```

Did it ? Great !
Got an `undefined` ? Try to find why. ;)

---

Mental exercise : Ask yourself what's the output in the console of :

```js
function logs() {
  console.log("Hello");
  console.log("World");
  return 4;
  console.log("Goodbye");
  console.log("World");
}

const myVariable = logs();

console.log(myVariable);
```

Test it and see if you were right.
Not quite there ? Try to understand why.

Remember : when you put parenthesis after a function, it automatically runs the function, even if you're assigning it to a variable.

Let's write a function to know if, depending on the weather, I should use a short or not.

Call it `isShortWeather` and it should return `true` if the temperature is above or equal to 24 degrees and `false` if it's under.

Example :

```js
isShortWeather(13); // false
isShortWeather(27); // true
isShortWeather(-7); // false
```

---

Please write a function called `lastElement` which accepts a single array argument. The function should return the last element of the array (without removing the element). If the array is empty, the function should return `null`.

```js
lastElement([3, 5, 7]); //7
lastElement([1]); //1
lastElement([]); //null
```

---

Define a function called `capitalize` that accepts a string argument and returns a new string with the first letter capitalized (but the rest of the string unchanged). For example:

```js
capitalize("eggplant"); // "Eggplant"
capitalize("pamplemousse"); // "Pamplemousse"
capitalize("squid"); //"Squid"
```

Hints:

Remember that strings are immutable, meaning that you cannot simply change the first letter in the original string. You will need to make a new string that you return.

Single out the first letter and capitalize it. (use a string method to help!)

Add that first letter to the rest of the original string, sliced to omit the original first letter (use a string method to help!)

For example: 'eggplant' becomes 'E' + 'ggplant'
