### Exercise on functions

---

Let's write function that throws as many dice we want with as many faces we want.

- Write a function that takes two parameters `faces` and `times`
- Inside of it, log to the console `times` times a die with `faces` faces.
- Console log : `die 1 : result`, `die 2 : result` for each die.

Expected result for, for example, `(6, 5)` (the numbers should be random of course)

```
"Die 1: 4"
"Die 2: 1"
"Die 3: 1"
"Die 4: 6"
"Die 5: 3"
```
